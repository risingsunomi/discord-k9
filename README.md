This was created initially for testing out the Discord API along with other obsecure APIs to interface through Discord API. Code will be updated and refactor as needed.

## Work in progress

[] [bug] Not all arrays are checked for data
[] [bug] Substring issues for empty text posts
[] [upgrade] HTML parsing needed for scraping search results from sites without an API
